This project is intended to serve as an interpreter for mathematical expressions.

✅ = Fully implemented and supported\
🛠️ = Partially implemented/supported but WIP\
❌ = Not implemented and supported yet
***

Features are:

✅ | Performing basic calculations\
✅ | Defining and using variables\
✅ | Defining and using functions\
✅ | 256 bit decimal accuracy\
✅ | Default functions/consts (for math and physics)\
✅ | Inferred multiplication i.e: `4 (3 + 2)` = `20`\
✅ | Using results of previous calculations\
🛠️ | Recursive functions\
🛠️ | Human readable diagnostics (errors, warnings, suggestions)\
🛠️ | Validation of input\
🛠️ | Api\
🛠️ | Equation solving/simplification\
❌ | Multithreading support for expensive calculations
